# mapgen

`mapgen` is a versatile tool for creating 128x128px bingo boards for the Minecraft Bingo game mode.<br/>
With full control over the board layout, difficulty, team configuration, colors, and various other constraints, mapgen lets you design highly customized bingo challenges for any scenario.
